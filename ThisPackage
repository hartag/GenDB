#R Package development system

#Package-specific variable declarations

##The name of the package, that is, the name of the directory containing 
##the package's DESCRIPTION file.
PKG-NAME=GenDB

##Extra package files
##The Makefile system includes many files by default when deciding 
##whether or not to rebuild an already built package.  If you discover
##files in your package that are not being taken into account, add there 
##paths to PKG-FILES.
PKG-FILES=

##Exclude files
##The system for building the file dependencies may include files that it 
##shouldn't, for example, backup files generated by editors, etc.  Patterns added 
##to the following variable will filter out such files so that the build rules 
##will not depend on them.
EXCLUDE-FILES=%.bak %~

##User Pager Preferences
##The following variables contain the name of the pager to be used 
##under different OS's.
WINDOWS-PAGER=notepad
UNIX-PAGER=vi
